# 3. Links: Hard vs. Symbolic (Soft) Links üîó

Mawa, Linux lo, manam oka file ki different names ivvochu, or oka file ki shortcuts create cheyochu. Ee concept ni **links** antaru. Evi chala powerful, kani ardam cheskovadaniki konchem tricky ga untayi.

There are two types of links in Linux: **Hard Links** and **Symbolic (or Soft) Links**.

## What is an Inode?

Ee links ardam cheskovali ante, mundu manam **inode** ante ento teluskovali. Prathi file and directory ki filesystem lo oka unique ID number untundi, daanne inode number antaru. Ee inode lo file ‡∞Ø‡±ä‡∞ï‡±ç‡∞ï metadata (permissions, owner, size, and most importantly, aa file data disk lo ekkada store ayyindo aa pointer) antha store ayyi untundi.

A filename is just a human-readable label that points to an inode.

## Hard Links

*   **What it is:** A hard link is a **direct pointer to an inode**. Ante, manam oka file ki inko peru isthunnam anamata. Rendu file names, kani oke inode, oke data on the disk. It's like one person having two official names.
*   **How to create:** `ln <original_file> <new_link_name>`
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   All hard links are equal. Original file delete chesina, link untene data safe ga untundi. Anni links delete aithe ne, disk lo unna data space free avtundi.
    *   You **cannot** create a hard link for a directory.
    *   You **cannot** create a hard link across different filesystems (e.g., from your main drive to a USB drive).

*   **Real-World Usage:**
    ```bash
    # Create a file
    echo "This is the original data." > original.txt

    # Create a hard link to it
    ln original.txt hardlink.txt

    # Let's check their inode numbers using ls -i
    ls -i original.txt hardlink.txt
    # Output: 131075 original.txt  131075 hardlink.txt  <-- SAME INODE NUMBER!

    # Now, let's delete the original file
    rm original.txt

    # Is the data still there? Yes!
    cat hardlink.txt
    # Output: This is the original data.
    ```

---

## Symbolic Links (Symlinks or Soft Links)

*   **What it is:** A symbolic link is **not a direct pointer to the inode**. It's a special file that contains the **path** to another file or directory. It's just a shortcut, like a Windows shortcut.
*   **How to create:** `ln -s <original_file_or_directory> <new_link_name>` (The `-s` is for symbolic).
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   It's just a pointer. If you delete the original file, the link becomes a "dangling" or "broken" link. It points to nothing.
    *   You **can** create symbolic links for directories. This is very common.
    *   You **can** create symbolic links across different filesystems.

*   **Real-World Usage:**
    ```bash
    # Create a file
    echo "This is some data." > data.txt

    # Create a symbolic link to it
    ln -s data.txt symlink.txt

    # Let's check their inodes and ls -l output
    ls -li data.txt symlink.txt
    # Output:
    # 131076 -rw-r--r-- 1 jules jules 20 Sep  2 19:00 data.txt
    # 131077 lrwxrwxrwx 1 jules jules  8 Sep  2 19:01 symlink.txt -> data.txt <-- DIFFERENT INODES!

    # Now, let's delete the original file
    rm data.txt

    # Try to access the data via the symlink
    cat symlink.txt
    # Output: cat: symlink.txt: No such file or directory  <-- It's broken!
    ```

## Visualizing the Difference

Ee Mermaid diagram tho difference inka clear ga ardam avtundi.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "File System"
        direction LR
        I1["Inode 131075<br/>(Metadata for 'Hello')"]
        I2["Inode 131077<br/>(Type: Symlink<br/>Content: 'path/to/file1')"]
        D1["Data Block<br/>'Hello'"]
    end

    subgraph "Directory Entries (Filenames)"
        F1["file1.txt"]
        F2["hardlink.txt"]
        F3["symlink.txt"]
    end

    F1 -- "Points to" --> I1
    F2 -- "Points to" --> I1

    style I2 fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```
Hard links (`file1.txt`, `hardlink.txt`) rendu oke inode ni point chestunnayi. Symbolic link (`symlink.txt`) ki oka separate inode undi, and aa inode lo unna data just inkoka file yokka path matrame.

## Summary: Hard vs. Soft

| Feature                      | Hard Link                                  | Symbolic (Soft) Link                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **What it points to**        | The Inode (the actual data)                | The Filename (a path)                      |
| **Can link to directories?** | No                                         | **Yes**                                    |
| **Cross filesystems?**       | No                                         | **Yes**                                    |
| **If original is deleted...**| Link still works, data is safe.            | Link is broken ("dangling").               |
| **Command**                  | `ln target link`                           | `ln -s target link`                        |

Mawa, 99% of the time nuvvu use chesedi **symbolic links**. They are more flexible and intuitive. Next, manam ee files and links ni system lo ela vethakalo nerchukundam.
