*   **Common "Power-ups" (Options):**
    *   `-s <shell_path>`: Sets the new shell.
    *   `-l` (**l**ist): Lists all available shells on the system (from `/etc/shells`).
*   **Real-World Usage:**
    A user `ravi` was created with the default `/bin/sh`, but now he needs `bash`.
    ```bash
    # See available shells
    chsh -l

    # Change ravi's shell to /bin/bash
    sudo chsh -s /bin/bash ravi

    # Verify the change in /etc/passwd
    grep ravi /etc/passwd
    ```
*   **Sample Output (`grep ravi`):**
    ```text
    ravi:x:1004:1004::/home/ravi:/bin/bash
    ```
    You can also disable a user's login ability by setting their shell to `/sbin/nologin`.

*   **How it works:** Running `chfn <username>` will interactively prompt you to enter the user's Full Name, Room Number, Work Phone, and Home Phone.
*   **Real-World Usage:**
    Our user `sita` was created with the comment "Sita, Developer". Let's add more details.
    ```bash
    # Change info for sita
    sudo chfn sita
    # It will then ask you for the details one by one.

    # Let's see the result
    finger sita
    ```

    ```text
    Login: sita                             Name: Sita, Developer
    Directory: /home/sita                   Shell: /bin/bash
